# Python-Challenge

## Background

Well... you've made it!

It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. Welcome to the world of programming with Python. In this assignment, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete the **two** Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation where your newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy. These challenges are far from easy so expect some hard work ahead!

### Before You Begin

* Create a new repository for this project called `python-challenge`. 

* Clone the new repository to your computer.

* Inside your local git repository, create a directory for both of the  Python Challenges. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: **PyBank** and  **PyPoll**.

* Inside of each folder that you just created, add the following:

  * A new file called `main.py`. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
  * A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure your script has the correct path to the CSV file.
  * An "analysis" folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.

* Push the above changes to GitHub

## PyBank

* In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

* Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```

* In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

* In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

* You will be give a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

  ```text
  Election Results
  -------------------------
  Total Votes: 3521001
  -------------------------
  Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
  Correy: 20.000% (704200)
  Li: 14.000% (492940)
  O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)
  -------------------------
  Winner: Khan
  -------------------------
  ```

* In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# BONUS-I PyBoss

In this challenge, you get to be the _boss_. You oversee hundreds of employees across the country developing Tuna 2.0, a world-changing snack food based on canned tuna fish. Alas, being the boss isn't all fun, games, and self-adulation. The company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and unfortunately for you, the new system requires employee records be stored completely differently.

Your task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records to the required format. Your script will need to do the following:

* Import the `employee_data.csv` file, which currently holds employee records like the below:

```csv
Emp ID,Name,DOB,SSN,State
214,Sarah Simpson,1985-12-04,282-01-8166,Florida
15,Samantha Lara,1993-09-08,848-80-7526,Colorado
411,Stacy Charles,1957-12-20,658-75-8526,Pennsylvania
```

* Then convert and export the data to use the following format instead:

```csv
Emp ID,First Name,Last Name,DOB,SSN,State
214,Sarah,Simpson,12/04/1985,***-**-8166,FL
15,Samantha,Lara,09/08/1993,***-**-7526,CO
411,Stacy,Charles,12/20/1957,***-**-8526,PA
```

* In summary, the required conversions are as follows:

  * The `Name` column should be split into separate `First Name` and `Last Name` columns.

  * The `DOB` data should be re-written into `MM/DD/YYYY` format.

  * The `SSN` data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.

  * The `State` data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.

# BONUS-II PyParagraph

In this challenge, you get to play the role of chief linguist at a local learning academy. As chief linguist, you are responsible for assessing the complexity of various passages of writing, ranging from the sophomoric Twilight novel to the nauseatingly high-minded research article. Having read so many passages, you've since come up with a fairly simple set of metrics for assessing complexity.

Your task is to create a Python script to automate the analysis of any such passage using these metrics. Your script will need to do the following:

* Import a text file filled with a paragraph of your choosing.

* Assess the passage for each of the following:

  * Approximate word count

  * Approximate sentence count

  * Approximate letter count (per word)

  * Average sentence length (in words)

## Hints and Considerations
* Write one script for each dataset provided. Run your script separately to make sure that the code works for its respective dataset.
